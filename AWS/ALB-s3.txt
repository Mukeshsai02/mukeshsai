What is load balancing?
• Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple
servers (EC2 Instances) downstream.

ALB :-
is to route the particular target groups.
it will run through particular paths.
CLB :-
is to follow round  robin algorithm.
if suppose same applic'n are running there in 10 instances in zone1 & 10 in zone2
Every time it will run 1 alternative other servers.

> Application load balancers is Layer 7 (HTTP)
• Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines(target groups)
• Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine
(ex: containers)
• Support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket
• Support redirects (from HTTP to HTTPS for example)
• Routing tables to different target groups:
• Routing based on path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
• Routing based on hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)
• Routing based on Query String, Headers
(example.com/users?id=123&order=false)
• ALB are a great fit for micro services & container-based application
(example: Docker & Amazon ECS)
• Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS


s3
------------------------------------
aws s3 ls - To see the list of buckets
aws s3 mb s3://s3-demo(new bucket name)  ->  To create a bucket name
aws s3 mb s3://s3-demo123 --region us-east-2  -> create a bucket in specific region
aws s3 ls s3://s3-demo  -> To display the items inside bucket.
aws s3 rb s3://s3-demo   -> To remove the empty bucket   

versioning(properties-enable version) - It is used to store the diff versions of data of same file in s3 .
Ex:- if suppose for o.s versions are getting updated. all the versio will store in s3,whenever we need we can reuse it. 



To Upload data from local to s3 bucket
----------------------------------------------
cd /var/www/html/
touch tulasi.txt
echo "uploading sample test file" > tulasi.txt
cat tulasi 
aws s3 cp /root/tulasi.txt s3://s3-ramya/

/*
cd ../..
aws s3 sync /var/www/html/ s3://s3-demo123/
*/


https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/move-objects-s3-bucket/
->aws s3 sync s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-SOURCE s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-TARGET



Accessing using aws-cli
---------------------------------------
apt-get update -y
aws configure
aws s3 ls 		-> check s3 data
aws ec2 describe-instances 
aws ec2 describe-instances --output table -> displays in table format
