VPC & Subnets Primer
• VPC: private network to deploy your resources (regional resource).
• Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC
(Availability Zone resource)
• A public subnet is a subnet that is accessible from the internet
• A private subnet is a subnet that is not accessible from the internet (global network).
• To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route Tables.

Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways
------------------------------------
• Internet Gateways helps our VPC instances connect with the internet.
• Public Subnets have a route to the internet gateway.
• NAT Gateways (AWS-managed) & NAT Instances (self-managed) allow your instances in your Private Subnets to access the internet while remaining private.

Network ACL & Security Groups :-
-------------------------------
• NACL (Network ACL)
• A firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet
• Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
• Are attached at the Subnet level
• Rules only include IP addresses
Security Groups :-
• A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI / an EC2 Instance.
• Can have only ALLOW rules
• Rules include IP addresses and other security groups.

VPC Flow Logs:-
------------------
Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
• VPC Flow Logs
• Subnet Flow Logs
• Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs
Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues. Example:
• Subnets to internet
• Subnets to subnets
• Internet to subnets
Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora, etc…
VPC Flow logs data can go to S3 / CloudWatch Logs.

vpc Peering:-
------------------------------
• Connect two VPC, privately using AWS’ network should be in same network.
• Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
• VPC Peering connection is not transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another).
Ex:-
-------
You have 3 VPCs A, B, and C. You want to establish a VPC Peering connection between all the 3 VPCs. What should you do?
Establish 3 vpc peering connections(A-B,A-C,B-c).

vpc Endpoints:-
----------------------------
Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public www network.
• This gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services.
• When using VPC Endpoints, we have only two AWS services that have a Gateway Endpoint amazon s3 and dynamo db. 

Site to Site VPN:-
------------------------------------
• Connect an on-premises VPN to AWS and access over the public internet.
• The connection is automatically encrypted

Direct Connect (DX):-
• Establish a physical connection between onpremises and AWS and access over the private internet.
• The connection is private, secure and fast
• Takes at least a month to establish
Note:- Site-to-site VPN and Direct Connect cannot access VPC endpoints
