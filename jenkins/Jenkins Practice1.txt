Jenkins has continues Integration and Continues delivery and deployement.

> Devlopers push code to git and we took the code and using maven we build the code and perform CI/Cd operation.
> But all the above steps we follow manually using command line but no one preper to do manually. 
> Every thing needs to be automated through CI/Cd pipeline, To do CI/Cd pipeline we have many tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, AWS CodeBuild, Azure DevOps,
 Atlassian Bamboo, or Travis CI among all we use Jenkins becoz - we have beautiful UI and we can get to where pipeline breaks and we can track easily.
> There is image saved in jenkins folder pipeline workflow will follow same.
> In Prod no one deploy the code directly there will be permissions given to deploy it we need to follow accordingly.

. and do build now option, check the build success and in console output it shows build workspace 
. In ubuntu server go to workspace and open the build workspace path we can see game-of -life code
. Within the workspace we can see created Jobs here 
. If someone do code commis in master branch then build need to trigger automatically, so we use jenkins
Eg: Game-of-life project is 1 feature to create 1 website there will be different features to create each build it will be difficult job, Using automation
scripting we can create build and trigger job successfully.
