 Suppose we have some different types of jobs in single server like freestyle and multi branch it's running in 1 server.
if server get crashed then we need to configure everything from the begining to recover all the data without loss we use jenkins pipeline.
Instaed of doing manually we use it pipeline. This jenkins pipeline will be place with in github source code, pipeline will be added with in source code.
> There r 2 types of pipeline, 1 . Declarative 2. Scripted
1 Declarative : Pipeline starts with 'pipeline'
  pipeline {            - pipeline starts with pipeline
   agent any{           - will be discussed in slave and master concept ( suppose instance is in t2 micro if its get full we cant go and make size full know 
using agent any will tranfer work load to other server will integrate jenkins to new server )

    tools {             - tools will be declared within this
      // Install the Maven version configured as "M3" and add it to the path.
	  jdk 'java8'
      maven "Maven3.3.9"
   }
   
stages                     - with in stages all the stage declared
   {
   stage('git clone') {   - defined what the particular stage will does
         steps {           - for each stage  their will be step started and ended
            // Get some code from a GitHub repository          ( code will be written inside step)
            git 'https://github.com/snehitha-reddy/Game.git'
        }
	}
	stage ('Compile and Build') {
         steps {
           sh '''
           mvn clean install -U  -Dmaven.test.skip=true 
           '''
         }
	}

	}
}

- Create pipeline job and in pipeline option we can fetch code from git or pipeline script
- If we fetch code from git then jenkins file should be added in source code else if we choose pipeline script then script will be written within it
 2 Scripted: Pipeline starts with node
node("myAgent"){
  timeout(unit: 'SECONDS', time: 5) {
      stage ("One"){
        sleep 10
          echo 'hello'
  }
}
}
> Create a pipleline and select pipeline script then do scripting and run the job check whether it's working or not

To do task:
--------------
> Do practice for customized port for jenkins browse it and do practice
> How to provide user access from our account to others ( Practice role based and metric based)
> User access for job , user permissions, try with build and read only access
> About Think backup plugin - using this we can backup & restore server ( incase we loose server also we can restore it using this plugin)
> Through backend how to restore files using terminal practice once on this also
