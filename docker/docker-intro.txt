physical machine
laptop/desktop
Os
100gb harddisk

Jenkins ------ usage 5gb

Suppose in a ubuntu machine if we utilised only jenkins for 5 gb rest 95 gb is wasted cost of purchasing and wasting is loss of money

From this we got virtual machines

     Virtual machine
25      25       25         25
ubuntu centos    fedora     windows
jenkins
apt-get  yum                 
each Os utilised only 20gb remaining 10gb is wasted to overcome this they introduced docker


Docker - It's an Os level virtualisation
- Docker takes Linux Kernal os as an Os

Docker Hub
-From dockerhub we pull images to docker, it acts as github 
- It's an registry 

> With in docker we pull images and performs tasks and push it to registry, so there is no space wastage and utilization within docker
> It just acts as Os to perform tasks
> No memory consumption

.Here container is an Vm instance- virtual machine and image is an os
. To install jenkins in different OS no need use different commands to install it, instead of that we can use dockerfile to install jenkins in diff Os like windows, ubuntu , centos

Docker file syntax:-  To save docker in 'Dockerfile'
FROM                 ubuntu      ( this is an base image for docker file) using base image only os can be launched and performs below commands
MAINTAINER           prathyusha@gmail.com
RUN                  apt-get update && apt-get install jenkins && mkdir test
WORKDIR               test/
CMD                   [./shell]         (run time execution)
ENTRYPOINT            [./shell]        (run as an execution)
COPY                 /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/jar      test/
ADD                  wget https://                 (git clone form remote or local rep)
EXPOSE                 8083  ( Declare port to run in particular url)


commands

docker build -t jenkins .       (After writing docker file, to create image we use this command ( To build docker file, here it's to install jenkins file)
docker run -it                  ( On one container it runs in interactive mode 'it' , it goes within machine and works function)
Press ctrl+p, ctrl +s              (to come out on docker machine) 
docker attach jenkins   (to go inside docker machine )
docker exec -it conatainer /bin/bash   (other way to go inside dockr machine)

We can use any way to go inside docker

Docker Volume and Docker mount
creating volume: 
#docker volume create my-vol
TO inspect path:
#docker inspect volume volume-name
Docker mount:
sudo docker run -it -v geeksforgeeks:/shared-volume --name my-container-01 ubuntu
